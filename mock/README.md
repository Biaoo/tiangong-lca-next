# Mock Directory

This directory is reserved for mock data files if needed in the future.

The previous Ant Design Pro template mock files have been removed as they were not used in the actual project.

If you need to add mock data for development, you can add `.ts` or `.js` files here following the UmiJS mock conventions.
